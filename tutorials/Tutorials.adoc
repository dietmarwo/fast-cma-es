=== Log output of the parallel retry

The log output of the parallel retry contains the following rows:

==== Parallel retry

- time (in sec)
- evaluations / sec
- number of retries - optimization runs
- total number of evaluations in all retries
- best value found so far
- mean of the values found by the retries below the defined threshold
- standard deviation of the values found by the retries below the defined threshold
- list of the best 20 function values in the retry store
- best solution (x-vector) found so far

Mean and standard deviation would be misleading when using coordinated retry, because
of the retries initiated by crossover. Therefore the rows of the
log output differ slightly:

==== Smart retry

- time (in sec)
- evaluations / sec
- number of retries - optimization runs
- total number of evaluations in all retries
- best value found so far
- worst value in the retry store
- number of entries in the retry store
- list of the best 20 function values in the retry store
- best solution (x-vector) found so far
