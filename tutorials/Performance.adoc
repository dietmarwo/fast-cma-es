== Performance

=== Competitions

fcmaes gives you a clear advantage at an optimization competition like ESAs
https://optimise.esa.int/challenges[optimization challenges] if you exploit its
parallelization capabilities. Here is a list of the ranks achieved by fcmaes
https://optimise.esa.int/user/867404f708354718b547739c784da79c[fcmaes]:

For most challenges the fcmaes result is either the best or less than 1 % behind.
All competition code was written in Python - although fcmaes and or-tools wrap C++ code to improve performance. All these 15 challenges are still open, you can submit solutions and
you result will show at the leaderboard.

=== Engineering Design Optimization

In this domain we often have multiple competing objectives and a lot of constraints. We present results for the
http://ladse.eng.isas.jaxa.jp/benchmark/[Mazda real-world car structure design benchmark], the simultaneous
optimization of three car models minimizing their weight, increasing the number of shared thicknesses of structural  
parts thereby fulfilling 54 constraints. 2017 there was a competition related to this problem https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjpnsec/9/2/9_86/_article/-char/en[Report of Evolutionary Computation Competition 2017],
but until now not many of the ideas produced there have found their way into open source optimization libraries. 

We applied https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/modecpp.py[modecpp.py] for 
about 1 hour runtime using one AMD 5950x CPU on Linux, de/rand/1 strategy (nsga_update=False, pareto_update=False, ints=[True]*dim), 
population size = 256. We choose the best run out of two executed in parallel, each utilizing 16 threads (workers=16). 
This way about 8200 function evaluations are performed per second for both runs combined.  

The resulting pareto front with hypervolume 0.4074 is:

The "reference" NSGA-II solution given as part of the benchmark has hypervolume 0.1456:

Note, that the reference solution was computed using a limited budget. But NSGA-II scales much worse than fcmaes-MoDe
using https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjpnsec/11/2/11_18/_article/-char/en/[enhanced multiple constraint ranking]. 

=== Space Flight Trajectory Planning

Remark: This section was initially created in 2022 and updated in 2024. What changed:

- New hardware: CPU AMD 9950x replaced an AMD 5950x
- Hardware performance: The 9950x is about factor 1.75 faster than the 5950x for these benchmarks.
- Random generator: fcmaes switched from Mersenne Twister to https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/bit_generators/pcg64dxsm.html[PCG64 DXSM] both for Python and C++.

fcmaes provides fast parallel
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/advexamples.py[example solvers] for the 
real world space flight design problems https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop[GTOP] and for 
the https://mintoc.de/index.php/F-8_aircraft[F-8_aircraft] problem based on differential equations. 
On http://www.midaco-solver.com/index.php/about/benchmarks/gtopx[GTOPX] you can find implementations 
of the corresponding objective functions using different programming languages. The
solution times given in the tables below are for Linux / AMD 9950x CPU utilizing 32 parallel processes.

to reproduce these results. The same optimization algorithm
was applied for all problems, using the same parameters both for the optimization algorithm and the coordinated retry / boundary management.

=== ESAs Messenger-Full Space Trajectory Design Problem

Because of its famous complexity ESAs 26-dimensional https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/messenger_full/[Messenger full] 
problem is often referenced in the literature, see for instance http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/PDPTA20_Messenger.pdf[MXHCP paper].

fcmaes solves this problem in less than half an hour using an AMD 9950x.

The Problem models a multi-gravity assist interplanetary space mission from Earth to Mercury. In 2009 the first good solution (6.9 km/s) was submitted. It took more than five years to reach 1.959 km/s and three more years until 2017 to find the optimum 1.958 km/s. The picture below shows the progress of the whole science community since 2009:

The following picture shows 101 coordinated retry runs: 

image::mf3.6000.png[]  

60 out of these 101 runs produced a result better than 2 km/s:

image::mf3.2000.png[] 

About 2.1*10^6 function evaluations per second were performed which shows excellent scaling of the algorithm utilizing all 16 cores / 32 threads.
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-ray/blob/master/README.adoc[fcmaesray] shows how a 5 node cluster using 
96 CPU-cores executing fcmaes coordinated retry performs in comparison.
