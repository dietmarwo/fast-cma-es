== Performance

=== Engineering Design Optimization

In this domain we often have multiple competing objectives and a lot of constraints. We present results for the
http://ladse.eng.isas.jaxa.jp/benchmark/[Mazda real-world car structure design benchmark], the simultaneous
optimization of three car models minimizing their weight, increasing the number of shared thicknesses of structural  
parts thereby fulfilling 54 constraints. 2017 there was a competition related to this problem https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjpnsec/9/2/9_86/_article/-char/en[Report of Evolutionary Computation Competition 2017],
but until now not many of the ideas produced there have found their way into open source optimization libraries. 

We applied https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/modecpp.py[modecpp.py] for 
about 1 hour runtime using one AMD 5950x CPU on Linux, de/rand/1 strategy (nsga_update=False, pareto_update=False, ints=[True]*dim), 
population size = 256. We choose the best run out of two executed in parallel, each utilizing 16 threads (workers=16). 
This way about 8200 function evaluations are performed per second for both runs combined.  

The resulting pareto front with hypervolume 0.4074 is:

The "reference" NSGA-II solution given as part of the benchmark has hypervolume 0.1456:

Note, that the reference solution was computed using a limited budget. But NSGA-II scales much worse than fcmaes-MoDe
using https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjpnsec/11/2/11_18/_article/-char/en/[enhanced multiple constraint ranking]. 

=== Space Flight Trajectory Planning

fcmaes provides fast parallel
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/advexamples.py[example solvers] for the 
real world space flight design problems https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop[GTOP] and for 
the https://mintoc.de/index.php/F-8_aircraft[F-8_aircraft] problem based on differential equations. 
On http://www.midaco-solver.com/index.php/about/benchmarks/gtopx[GTOPX] you can find implementations 
of the corresponding objective functions using different programming languages. The
solution times given in the tables below are for Linux / AMD 5950x CPU.

Note that 'stopVal' is the threshold value determining success and
'mean time' includes the time for failed runs.
Execute https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/benchmark_gtop.py[benchmark_gtop.py]
to reproduce these results. The same optimization algorithm
was applied for all problems, using the same parameters both for the optimization algorithm and the coordinated retry.

=== ESAs Messenger-Full Space Trajectory Design Problem

Because of its famous complexity ESAs 26-dimensional https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/messenger_full/[Messenger full] 
problem is often referenced in the literature, see for instance http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/PDPTA20_Messenger.pdf[MXHCP paper].

fcmaes is the only library capable of solving it using a single CPU: 
In about 1950 seconds on average using an AMD 5950x (1250 seconds for the 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java[java] variant) .

The Problem models a multi-gravity assist interplanetary space mission from Earth to Mercury. In 2009 the first good solution (6.9 km/s) was submitted. It took more than five years to reach 1.959 km/s and three more years until 2017 to find the optimum 1.958 km/s. The picture below shows the progress of the whole science community since 2009:

The following picture shows 101 coordinated retry runs: 

image::mf3.6000.png[]  

60 out of these 101 runs produced a result better than 2 km/s:

image::mf3.2000.png[] 

About 1.2*10^6 function evaluations per second were performed which shows excellent scaling of the algorithm utilizing all 16 cores / 32 threads.  
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/README.adoc shows that the fcmaes java implementation sharing 
the same C++ code is significantly faster. 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-ray/blob/master/README.adoc[fcmaesray] shows how a 5 node cluster using 
96 CPU-cores executing fcmaes coordinated retry performs in comparison.
