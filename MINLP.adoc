== Solving Mixed Integer Problems


=== Introduction

What if some of the variables of our optimization problem are restricted to be integers
(see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/gear_train.py[gear_train.py]) - or
are integer multiples of some real value (see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/vessel.py[vessel.py])?

We could define all variables as continuous and map these to the nearest feasible value as done in both examples above. The vessel example has shown, that we have to be careful when using an optimizer
which utilizes derivatives - since this mapping destroys the smoothness of the objective function. 
All fcmaes algorithms are derivative-free. So we don't expect problems here. 

Alternatively we can view instances of all integer variables as integer sequence and enumerate all sequences. Then we could solve all problems associated with these instances. 

Example: https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/tandem/[TandEM] is formulated as a set of separate problems, each associated with an integer sequence - the sequence of planets visited on the tour reaching Titan and Enceladus (two moons of Saturn). This set of problems could be combined to a single one using integer variables. Or we could try to solve all problems simultaneously. Lets discuss the advantages and disadvantages of all three methods to find the best solution for the best sequence of integer instances:

1) Solve all problems sequentially:

- No additional variables means no increased complexity for each problem.
- Sequential execution means low memory requirements.
- Existing methods work "out of the box".

But:

- There could be a huge number of sequences which means high execution time.
- Same effort for all sequences, for the bad ones we waste time. 

2) Mixed Integer approach - adding integer variables:

- Moderate memory requirements, since we only need to store data for one optimizing run.
- Works well with derivative free optimizers

But:

- Complexity is much higher because of the additional variables.
- Integer sequences can only be restricted by boxed bounds. Sometimes sequences can be excluded using domain knowledge. For https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/tandem/[TandEM] using boxed bounds we would get 24 possible sequences (2*3*4),
but only 18 were identified as feasible by the domain experts from ESA. 

3) Simultaneous optimization of all sequences:

- Saves execution time since bad sequences can be filtered out early. 
- Same complexity than the sequential approach. 

But:

- Data for all sequences need to be stored in memory which increases memory consumption. 
- If there are many integer variables not tightly bounded the number of sequences could explode. 

We conclude:

- The sequential approach should only be applied if all problem variations produce similar solutions.  
- The mixed integer approach is preferable if the number of corresponding sequences is very high and/or
the problem is not very complex.
- The simultaneous optimization approach is preferable if sequences can be excluded using domain knowledge
and their number doesn't cause memory issues and/or the problem is so complex.  
- If the problem is very complex and we have a huge number of sequences we could start with the mixed integer approach to identify quickly promising sequences, the then apply the simultaneous optimization approach to these sequences. 

For https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/tandem/[TandEM] we will compare the mixed integer approach with the 
simultaneous optimization approach.

==== TandEm-MINLP

TandEM is an interplanetary mission aimed at reaching Titan and Enceladus (two moons of Saturn). 
We aim at maximizing the mass delivered to a high eccentricity final orbit. We choose the time limited variant here, which is a more realistic "real world" problem. With 18 parameters TandEM is not easy to solve, even with a fixed planet sequence.  

Start at earth and a target Saturn are given, but there are three planet gravity assist flybys in between. The original problem lists 18 suggested flyby sequences, but we can reformulate the problem as TandEm-MINLP by adding three more integer variables describing the sequence. We restrict the three flybys to "Venus {plus} Earth", "Venus {plus} Earth {plus} Mars" and 
"Venus {plus} Earth {plus} Mars {plus} Jupiter" respectively resulting in 24 possible sequences which include the 18 suggested ones. 

TandEm is included in http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/gtopx/cpp/gtopx.cpp[gtopx.cpp] and 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/astro.py[astro.py] provides its `Tandem_minlp` extension. We apply the coordinated retry as usual:

[source,python]
----
def test_optimizer(opt, problem, num_retries = 120000, num = 100, 
                    value_limit = -10.0, log = logger()):
    log.info(problem.name + ' ' + opt.name)
    for _ in range(num):
        ret = advretry.minimize(problem.fun, problem.bounds, value_limit, 
                                num_retries, log, optimizer=opt)

	
test_optimizer(de_cma(1500), Tandem_minlp()) 
----

and get

image::tandem-minlp.png[]

TandEm-MINLP is tractable, we find the optimum around 1500 km/s, but the complexity of this 
problem is comparable with the Messenger-Full problem. 
 
==== Eliminating sequences 

Converting TandEm into a mixed integer problem is not the only approach. It pushed the coordinated retry to its limits since we used only a 16 core CPU. Alternatively we could use the simultaneous optimization approach,
which evaluates all problem variants at the same time. Each iteration the worst 30% are removed, so that
more time is spent on the promising planet sequences. 

[source,python]
----
def test_multiretry(num_retries = 512, 
             keep = 0.7, optimizer = de_cma(1500), logger = logger(), repeat = 50):
    seqs = Tandem(0).seqs
    n = len(seqs)
    problems = [Tandem(i) for i in range(n)]
    ids = [str(seqs[i]) for i in range(n)]
    for _ in range(100):
    	 # sort the problem variations
        problem_stats = multiretry.minimize(problems, ids, num_retries, keep, optimizer, logger)
        ps = problem_stats[0] # focus on the best one
        for _ in range(repeat):
            logger.info("problem " + ps.prob.name + ' ' + str(ps.id))
            ps.retry(optimizer)

test_multiretry(repeat = 50)
----

After 1326 sec we get the following sorted list of planet sequences:

For the best sequence we already got an optimal solution, otherwise we could continue to further evaluate the best ones. 

=== Cassini1-MINLP

Here http://www.midaco-solver.com/index.php/about/benchmarks/gtopx[Midaco/GTOPX] we find 
the example Cassini1-MINLP. As the name indicates, this is not a linear programming problem, 
the objective function is not linear. MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problems with linear
objective functions are easy to solve and require different algorithms to maximize efficiency. 

It is recommended to read http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/CEC2019_Schlueter_Munetomo.pdf[CEC2019]
first, it contains a detailed description of the problem:

We have mentioned the https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/cassini1/[Cassini] problem already in 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/PYKEP.adoc[Pykep gym results], Cassini1-MINLP is an extension of this benchmark. The original https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/[Cassini Mission]
to Saturn involved four gravity-assists at Venus, Venus, Earth and Jupiter to save fuel. 
Cassini1-MINLP adds four variables performing the decision which planets to use for the four flybys. 
We show our results for the problem described in  http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/CEC2019_Schlueter_Munetomo.pdf[CEC2019] for their original integer variable bounds:

----
	lb = [-1000.,30.,100.,30.,400.,1000., 1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0 ],
	ub = [0.,400.,470.,400.,2000.,6000., 9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0 ]       
----

And also for limited bounds where we apply domain knowledge. For the first three flybys we allow only
Mecury, Venus and Earth, for the last one we allow only Jupiter. 

----
	lb = [-1000.,30.,100.,30.,400.,1000., 0.51,0.51,0.51,4.51 ],
	ub = [0.,400.,470.,400.,2000.,6000., 3.49,3.49,3.49,5.49 ]        
----

image::cass1-minlp.png[]

As we can see, both problems are tractable. But we also observe that the best solution around 
`dv = 3.50` is guarded by a very dominant local optimum at `dv = 3.63` so we could alternatively
simply try all sequences. You cannot reproduce this result with fcmaes because there is a bug in the
original result and we reintroduced this bug specifically to get comparable results. The problem
is that Cassini1 has inequality constraints which are enforced by a penalty inside the GTOP code. 
These constraints are planet specific and the penalties adapt to the planet sequence. 
http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/CEC2019_Schlueter_Munetomo.pdf[CEC2019] unfortunately added 
fixed constraints which only work for the original planet sequence. Although the resulting problem
has no relation to the "real world" it is nevertheless interesting since it represents a kind of
worst case scenario for the MINLP approach.  

=== Cassini1-MINLP with correct constraints

Lets apply fcmaes coordinated retry using the default optimizer `de_cma` (see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/cassini_minlp.py[cassini_minlp.py]) allowing all nine planets in the sequence which results in 9^4 = 6561 possible combinations:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes.astro import Cassini1minlp
from fcmaes.optimizer import logger
from fcmaes.advretry import minimize

def test_optimizer(problem, num_retries = 100000, num = 100, value_limit = 100.0, log = logger()):
    log.info(problem.name + ' ' + opt.name)
    for i in range(num):
        ret = minimize(problem.fun, problem.bounds, value_limit, num_retries, log)

test_optimizer(Cassini1minlp()) 
----

We set `num_retries = 100000` because we expect the problem to be hard to solve. 
We execute the code on an AMD 3950x 16 core processor at 4.0GHZ. The results are surprising:

image::minlp.png[]

We observe strong "resistance" at deltaV = 2.896, but after about 1000 sec this value is 
improved significantly in many runs. The best solution at deltaV = 2.17576 is reached only once out of 20 runs.

----

x = [-192.2248623732259, 47.13641665602527, 167.36749494279744, 315.1019785468309,

f(x) = 2.1757611862263295

==== Fixing the objective function

As already mentioned in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/PYKEP.adoc[pykep gym results] there is a fundamental flaw both in the https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/[GTOP] problems as also in their newer replacements https://github.com/esa/pykep/tree/master/pykep/trajopt/gym[pykep gym]:

Restricting the coasting trajectory legs to single revolution transfers has a number of nasty side effects, specially for the inner planets:

- Global optima are much better "shielded" since for long transfer times it is very unlikely to find a low deltaV single revolution transfer.
- Many good solutions involving multi-revolution coasting legs are invalid. 

This flaw artificially makes the GTOP problems harder to solve. This is not a "real world" issue, since in the real world there is no reason for the "single revolution" restriction. 

Although we don't know which planet sequence is best, we can at least narrow the parameter space. 
Heading to any planet outer than Earth for the first three flybys makes no sense, it would slow down the trajectory too much. With the same arguments the fourth encounter can be limited to Jupiter or some planet nearer to the sun as Jupiter. Which leads to the following limits with equal continuous intervals associated with each valid planet: 

----
	lb = [-1000.,30.,100.,30.,400.,1000., 0.51,0.51,0.51,2.51 ],
	ub = [0.,400.,470.,400.,2000.,6000., 3.49,3.49,3.49,5.49 ]       
----

After implementing a fix for GTOP using the new PYKEP Lambert solver we repeat the experiment using the restricted bounds excluding the outer planets.

image::minlp2.png[]

We observe much "smoother" curves which means there are many more good solutions. And the best one with `deltaV = 1.846` using planet sequence "Earth, Venus, Venus, Earth" is found in all ten runs after about 100 - 600 sec. 

==== Why did they use Venus Venus Earth Jupiter for the real Cassini mission?

The question why the sequence Venus, Venus, Earth, Jupiter was chosen for the real Cassini mission can easily be answered by checking the alternative planet sequences we found using the much more accurate model from 
https://github.com/esa/pykep/blob/master/pykep/trajopt/gym/_cassini2.py[pykep cassini2]. In https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/PYKEP.adoc[Pykep gym results] we find a visualisation of a good solution for the original planet sequence with deltaV = 0.729 km/s. A quick 5 min check for the other sequences shows:

- VVEJ: deltaV = 0.729 km/s
- EVEJ: deltaV = 2.434 km/s
- EEVE: deltaV = 2.606 km/s
- EVVE: deltaV = 3.534 km/s
- EMMJ: deltaV = 9.571 km/s

Using deep space maneuvers and a more accurate model of the real mission shows that VVEJ needs only a fraction of the deltaV compared to the other planet sequences.

=== GTOC1

The https://sophia.estec.esa.int/gtoc_portal/?page_id=13[GTOC1] competition was already discussed in detail in the https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/Tutorial.adoc[Tutorial]. This time we will show how to find a good planet sequence. We will use the "fixed multirevolution Lambert" version of the GTOP code which is not yet included in fcmaes. For GTOC1 this is an essential requirement for solutions which improve on the winning one from JPL. And we need a long planet sequence - therefore we had to add a `time of flight <= 30 year` constraint to the code. Our boxed constraints which define the timings are:

----
       lb = [3000.,14.,14.,14.,14.,14.,14.,300.,300.,300.,300.], 
       ub = [10000.,2000.,2000.,2000.,2000.,2000.,2000.,3000.,1000.,4000.,1000.] 
----
A typical planet sequence is for instance `[3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 5, 10]` with ten trajectory legs starting at Earth (3) and aiming at the asteroid which threatens our planet (10). 
Using domain knowledge we fix the last two flybys to Saturn and Jupiter and allow only Venus and Earth flybys in between. This leaves us with 2^7 = 128 different planet sequences. We don't expect to find big differences between the sequences, so we decide against using MINLP and for the simultaneous optimization approach:

[source,python]
----
def sequences():
    for p1 in range(2,4):
        for p2 in range(2, 4):
            for p3 in range(2, 4):
                for p4 in range(2, 4):
                    for p5 in range(2, 4):
                        for p6 in range(2, 4):
                            for p7 in range(2, 4):
                                yield[p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7]

def test_multiretry(num_retries = 1024), 
             keep = 0.7, optimizer = de_cma(1500), logger = logger(), repeat = 100):
    problems = []
    ids = []
    for seq in sequences():
        problems.append(Gtoc1(planets = seq))
        ids.append(str(seq))
    for _ in range(100):
        problem_stats = multiretry.minimize(problems, ids, num_retries, keep, optimizer, logger)
        ps = problem_stats[0]
        for _ in range(repeat):
            logger.info("problem " + ps.prob.name + ' ' + str(ps.id))
            ps.retry(optimizer)
----

Because of the enormous complexity of this task we define a base retry number of 1024 for each iteration. 
Each iteration 30% of the problem variations / sequences are filtered out. 
After about 25 minutes using the 3950X 16 core CPU we get our first ranking:

----
[3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3] -1708989.6693652852

Further evaluation of the first three sequences using the regular coordinated retry resulted in:

----
 [3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,6,5,10] score = -1927767
 [3,2,3,2,3,2,3,3,6,5,10] score = -1924321
 [3,3,2,3,2,3,3,3,6,5,10] score = -1906362
----

The order of the first three sequences was correctly predicted by the simultaneous retry 
and probably all of them would have been
sufficient to win the competition - JPL scored "only" 1850000. 
They all have very low deltaV impulses so that converting them into a low thrust trajectory is not difficult.
