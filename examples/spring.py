# This problem consists of minimizing the weight of a tension/compression spring subject to constraints on 
# shear stress, surge frequency and minimum deflection
# The design variables are:

# - x1: the mean coil diameter
# - x2: the wire diameter
# - x3: the number of active coils

# which are subject to four inequality constraints.
# fcmaes retry used with a penalty for constraint violations 'weight_penalty'
# works as well as scipy minimize.

# This example is taken from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300306015098

# Tested using https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html on Linux Mint 21.
