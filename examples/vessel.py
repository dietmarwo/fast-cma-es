# A cylindrical vessel is capped at both ends by hemispherical heads. The objective is to
# minimize the total weight, including the weight of material, forming and welding. There are four design variables:

# - x1: thickness of the shell
# - x2: thickness of the head
# - x3: inner radius
# - x4 length of cylindrical section of the vessel, not including the head

# x1 and x2 are integer multiples of 0.0625 inch, witch are
# the available thickness of rolled steel plates, 
# and x3 and x4 are continuous.
# x1 and x2 are made discrete by calling '_feasible(x)' in the objective function 'feasable_cost_penalty()
# This works well with derivative free optimizers, but never do this with scipy.minimize. 
# Try 'test_minimize_SLSQP' to see why. But this can be fixed by using 'cost_int_penalty' as
# objective function which adds a penalty for the "multiples of 0.0625" violation. 
# With fcmaes retry usually you can just "discretize" arguments. 

# This example is taken from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300306015098

# Tested using https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html on Linux Mint 21.
