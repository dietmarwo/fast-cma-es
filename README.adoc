= fcmaes - a Python 3 gradient-free optimization library

https://gitter.im/fast-cma-es/community[image:https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg[]]

fcmaes complements https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html[scipy optimize] by providing 
additional optimization methods, faster {cpp}/Eigen based implementations and a coordinated parallel retry mechanism. 
It supports the multi threaded application of different gradient free optimization algorithms. 

fcmaes started with a fast CMA-ES implementation combined with a new smart parallel retry mechanism aimed to solve
hard optimization problems from the space flight planning domain. It evolved to a general library of
state-of-the-art gradient free optimization algorithms applicable to all kind of real world problems covering
multi-objective and constrained problems. Its main algorithms are implemented both in Python and C++ and
support parallel fitness function evaluation.

=== Performance

In the literature optimization algorithms are often compared by the average result they achieve using a 
specific number of function evaluations. But in the real world faced with real optimization problems we are
usually interested in a different metric: How long does it take to compute a reasonable solution, say
not worse than 0.5% above the absolute optimum, with the given hardware. For an optimization library
this means: How long does it take to compute a reasonable solution if I choose the best algorithm(s) of
the library, optimally configured and optimally parallelized on the given hardware?

fcmaes provides fast parallel
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/advexamples.py[example solvers] for the 
real world space flight design problems https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop[GTOP] and for 
the https://mintoc.de/index.php/F-8_aircraft[F-8_aircraft] problem based on differential equations. 
On http://www.midaco-solver.com/index.php/about/benchmarks/gtopx[GTOPX] you can find implementations 
of the corresponding objective functions using different programming languages. The
solution times given in the tables below are for Linux / AMD 5950x CPU.

=== Optimization algorithms

To utilize modern many-core processors all single-objective algorithms should be used with the parallel retry for cheap fitness functions, otherwise use parallel function evaluation.  

- MO-DE: A new multi-objective optimization algorithm merging concepts from differential evolution and NSGA. 
Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/mode.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/modeoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Provides an ask/tell interface and supports constraints and parallel function evaluation. 
Can also be applied to single-objective problems with constraints. 

- BiteOpt algorithm from Aleksey Vaneev https://github.com/avaneev/biteopt[BiteOpt]. Only a C++ version is provided. If your problem is single objective and if you have no clue what algorithm to apply, try this first. Works well with almost all problems. For constraints you have to use weighted penalties.

- Differential Evolution: Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/de.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/deoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Additional concepts implemented are 
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309179699_Differential_evolution_for_protein_folding_optimization_based_on_a_three-dimensional_AB_off-lattice_model[temporal locality], stochastic reinitialization of individuals based on their age and oscillating CR/F parameters. Provides an ask/tell interface and supports parallel function evaluation. 

- CMA-ES: Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/cmaes.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/acmaesoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Provides an ask/tell interface and supports parallel function evaluation.
 
- GCL-DE: Eigen based implementation in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/gcldeoptimizer.cpp[C++]. See "A case learning-based differential evolution algorithm for global optimization of interplanetary trajectory design, Mingcheng Zuo, Guangming Dai, Lei Peng, Maocai Wang, Zhengquan Liu", https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106451[doi].

- Dual Annealing: Eigen based implementation in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/daoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Use the https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.dual_annealing.html[scipy implementation] if you prefer a pure python variant or need more configuration options. 

- Expressions: There are two operators for constructing expressions over optimization algorithms: Sequence and random choice.
Not only the five single objective algorithms above, but also scipy and NLopt optimization methods and custom algorithms can be used for defining algorithm expressions. 
 
=== Installation

==== Linux
 
* `pip install fcmaes`. In case of issues with dependent libraries on old systems all dependent so-files are in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/lib. 

==== Windows

* `pip install fcmaes`
* install {cpp} runtime libraries https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads

Python multiprocessing is currently flawed on Windows. To get optimal scaling from parallel retry and parallel function evaluation use:

* Linux subsystem for Windows:
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[Linux subsystem] or
- https://superuser.com/questions/1271682/is-there-a-way-of-installing-ubuntu-windows-subsystem-for-linux-on-win10-v170[Ubuntu subsystem].

The Linux subsystem can read/write NTFS, so you can do your development on a NTFS partition. Just the Python call is routed to Linux. 

==== MacOS

* `pip install fcmaes`
* For using the {cpp} optimization algorithms: 
** adapt https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/CMakeLists.txt[CMakeLists.txt]
** generate the shared library: `cmake . ; make install` 

=== Usage

Usage is similar to https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html[scipy.optimize.minimize].

For parallel retry use:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes.optimizer import logger
from fcmaes import retry
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger())
----

The retry logs mean and standard deviation of the results, so it can be used to test and compare optimization algorithms:
You may choose different algorithms for the retry:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes.optimizer import logger, Bite_cpp, De_cpp, Cma_cpp, Sequence
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger(), optimizer=Bite_cpp(100000))
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger(), optimizer=De_cpp(100000))
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger(), optimizer=Cma_cpp(100000))
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, logger=logger(), optimizer=Sequence([De_cpp(50000), Cma_cpp(50000)]))
----

Here https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/examples.py[examples.py] you find examples.
Check the https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorial.adoc[Tutorial] for more details. 

In https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/advexamples.py[tutorial.py] and https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/advexamples.py[advexamples.py] you find examples for the smart retry. 

=== Log output of the parallel retry

The log output of the parallel retry contains the following rows:

===== Parallel retry

- time (in sec)
- evaluations / sec
- number of retries - optimization runs
- total number of evaluations in all retries
- best value found so far
- mean of the values found by the retries below the defined threshold
- standard deviation of the values found by the retries below the defined threshold
- list of the best 20 function values in the retry store
- best solution (x-vector) found so far

Mean and standard deviation would be misleading when using coordinated retry, because
of the retries initiated by crossover. Therefore the rows of the
log output differ slightly:
 
===== Smart retry

- time (in sec)
- evaluations / sec
- number of retries - optimization runs
- total number of evaluations in all retries
- best value found so far
- worst value in the retry store
- number of entries in the retry store
- list of the best 20 function values in the retry store
- best solution (x-vector) found so far

=== ESAs Messenger-Full Space Trajectory Design Problem

Because of its famous complexity ESAs 26-dimensional https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/messenger_full/[Messenger full] 
problem is often referenced in the literature, see for instance http://www.midaco-solver.com/data/pub/PDPTA20_Messenger.pdf[MXHCP paper].

fcmaes is the only library capable of solving it using a single CPU: 
In about 1950 seconds on average using an AMD 5950x (1250 seconds for the 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java[java] variant) .

The Problem models a multi-gravity assist interplanetary space mission from Earth to Mercury. In 2009 the first good solution (6.9 km/s) was submitted. It took more than five years to reach 1.959 km/s and three more years until 2017 to find the optimum 1.958 km/s. The picture below shows the progress of the whole science community since 2009:

image::Fsc.png[]  

The following picture shows 101 coordinated retry runs: 

image::mf3.6000.png[]  

60 out of these 101 runs produced a result better than 2 km/s:

image::mf3.2000.png[] 

About 1.2*10^6 function evaluations per second were performed which shows excellent scaling of the algorithm utilizing all 16 cores / 32 threads.  
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/README.adoc shows that the fcmaes java implementation sharing 
the same C++ code is significantly faster. 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-ray/blob/master/README.adoc[fcmaesray] shows how a 5 node cluster using 
96 CPU-cores executing fcmaes coordinated retry performs in comparison.
