fcmaes complements https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html[scipy optimize] by providing 
additional optimization methods, faster {cpp}/Eigen based implementations and a coordinated parallel retry mechanism. 
It supports the multi threaded application of different gradient free optimization algorithms. 
There are 35 real world https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorials.adoc[tutorials]
showing in detail how to use fcmaes. 
See https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/Performance.adoc[performance]
for detailed fcmaes performance figures. 

fcmaes started as a fast CMA-ES implementation combined with a new smart parallel retry mechanism aimed to solve
hard optimization problems from the space flight planning domain. It evolved to a general library of
state-of-the-art gradient free optimization algorithms applicable to all kind of real world problems covering
multi-objective and constrained problems. Its main algorithms are implemented both in Python and C++ and
support both parallel fitness function evaluation and a parallel retry mechanism. 

=== Update: How to compute weighted spherical t-designs

https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/SphericalTDesign.adoc[Spherical t-design] New example shows how to compute weighted spherical t-designs.

=== Update: Interaction between AI code generation and optimization

LLMs can help to generate code implementing a trading strategy. It can even propose ways to optimize the final return. 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/prophet_opt.py[prophet_opt.py] shows: 

- The o1-preview prompts used to generate the strategy back-testing code.
- How to identify the parameters to optimize using the AI.  
- How the parameter optimization process can be automated efficiently utilizing trading simulations executed in parallel.

This idea can be applied everywhere when parameters of time consuming simulations have to be optimized.  
If you aim to optimize multiple objectives, you may find many other examples in:

- Selection of highly efficient single-objective algorithms to choose from.
- Ask-tell interface for CMA-ES, CR-FM-NES, DE, MODE and PGPE.
- Large collection of 35 tutorials related to real world problems: 
  https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorials.adoc[tutorials].

=== Changes from version 1.6.3:

- Logging now based on loguru. All examples are adapted.
- New dependencies: loguru + numba.
- New tutorial related to the https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/spoc-2023/[GECCO 2023] Space Optimization Competition:
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/ESAChallenge.adoc[ESAChallenge].
- You can define an initial population as guess for multi objective optimization.

=== Changes from version 1.4.0:

- Pure Python versions of the algorithms are now usable also for parallel retry. Pure Python features: 
Algorithms: CMA-ES, CR-FM-NES, DE, MODE (multiple objective), Map-Elites+Diversifier (quality diversity). All 
Python algorithms support an ask-tell interface and parallel function evaluation. Additionally parallel retry / advanced retry (smart boundary management) are supported for these algorithms.
- Python version > 3.7 required, 3.6 is no longer supported.
- https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/[PEP 0484] compatible type hints useful for IDEs like PyCharm. 
- Most algorithms now support an unified ask/tell interface: cmaes, cmaescpp, crfmnes, crfmnescpp, de, decpp, mode, modecpp, pgpecpp.
This is useful for monitoring and parallel fitness evaluation. 
- Added support for Quality Diversity [QD]: MAP-Elites with additional CMA-ES emitter, new meta-algorithm Diversifier, a generalized
variant of CMA-ME, "drill down" for specified niches and bidirectional archive <-> store transfer between the QD-archive and
the smart boundary management meta algorithm (advretry). All QD algorithms support parallel optimization utilizing all CPU-cores
and statistics for solutions associated to a specific niche: mean, stdev, maximum, minimum and count.

Derivative free optimization of machine learning models often have several thousand decision
variables and require GPU/TPU based parallelization both of the fitness evaluation and the optimization algorithm. 
CR-FM-NES, PGPE and the QD-Diversifier applied to CR-FM-NES (CR-FM-NES-ME) are excellent choices in this domain. 
Since fcmaes has a different focus (parallel optimizations and parallel fitness evaluations) we contributed these
algorithms to https://github.com/google/evojax/tree/main/evojax/algo[EvoJax] which utilizes https://github.com/google/jax[JAX]
for GPU/TPU execution. 

=== Optimization algorithms

To utilize modern many-core processors all single-objective algorithms should be used with the parallel retry for cheap fitness functions, otherwise use parallel function evaluation.  

- MO-DE: A new multi-objective optimization algorithm merging concepts from differential evolution and NSGA. 
Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/mode.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/modeoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Provides an ask/tell interface and supports constraints and parallel function evaluation. 
Can also be applied to single-objective problems with constraints. Supports mixed integer problems (see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/FluidDynamics.adoc[CFD] for details)

- CVT-map-elites/CMA: A new Python implementation of CVT-map-elites including a CMA-ES emitter providing low algorithm overhead and excellent multi-core scaling even for fast fitness functions. Enables "drill down" for specific selected niches. See https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/mapelites.py[mapelites.py] and https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/MapElites.adoc[Map-Elites].

- Diversifier: A new Python meta-algorithm based on CVT-map-elites archives generalizing ideas from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02400.pdf[CMA-ME] to other wrapped algorithms. See https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/diversifier.py[diversifier.py] and https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/Diversity.adoc[Quality Diversity].

- BiteOpt algorithm from Aleksey Vaneev https://github.com/avaneev/biteopt[BiteOpt]. Only a C++ version is provided. If your problem is single objective and if you have no clue what algorithm to apply, try this first. Works well with almost all problems. For constraints you have to use weighted penalties.

- Differential Evolution: Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/de.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/deoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Additional concepts implemented are 
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309179699_Differential_evolution_for_protein_folding_optimization_based_on_a_three-dimensional_AB_off-lattice_model[temporal locality], stochastic reinitialization of individuals based on their age and oscillating CR/F parameters. Provides an ask/tell interface and supports parallel function evaluation. Supports mixed integer problems (see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/tutorials/FluidDynamics.adoc[CFD] for details)

- CMA-ES: Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/cmaes.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/acmaesoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Provides an ask/tell interface and supports parallel function evaluation. Good option for low number of decision variables (< 500). 

- CR-FM-NES: Fast Moving Natural Evolution Strategy for High-Dimensional Problems, see 
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11422. Derived from https://github.com/nomuramasahir0/crfmnes .
Implemented both in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/crfmnes.py[Python] and in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/crfmnes.cpp[C++]. Both implementations provide parallel function evaluation and an ask/tell interface. Good option for high number of decision variables (> 100). 

- PGPE Parameter Exploring Policy Gradients, see http://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1099128/631352.pdf . 
Implemented in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/pgpe.cpp[C++]. Provides parallel function evaluation and an ask/tell interface.
Good option for very high number of decision variables (> 1000) and for machine learning tasks. An equivalent Python implementation can be found at 
https://github.com/google/evojax/blob/main/evojax/algo/pgpe.py[pgpe.py], use this on GPUs/TPUs.   

- Wrapper for https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/cmaes[cmaes] which provides different CMA-ES variants implemented in Python like
separable CMA-ES and CMA-ES with Margin (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13482) which improves support for mixed integer problems. The wrapper additionally supports
parallel function evaluation.
 
- Dual Annealing: Eigen based implementation in https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/_fcmaescpp/daoptimizer.cpp[C++]. Use the https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.dual_annealing.html[scipy implementation] if you prefer a pure Python variant or need more configuration options. 

- Expressions: There are two operators for constructing expressions over optimization algorithms: Sequence and random choice.
Not only the single objective algorithms above, but also scipy and NLopt optimization methods and custom algorithms can be used for defining algorithm expressions.
 
=== Installation

==== Linux
 
* `pip install fcmaes`.

* Recommended Python environment: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge[miniforge Python 12].

==== Windows

* `pip install fcmaes`

* Install {cpp} runtime libraries https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads

* Recommended Python environment: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge[miniforge Python 12].

For parallel fitness function evaluation use the native Python optimizers
or the ask/tell interface of the {cpp} ones. Python multiprocessing works better on Linux. 
To get optimal scaling from parallel retry and parallel function evaluation use:

* Linux subsystem for Windows https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/[WSL].

The Linux subsystem can read/write NTFS, so you can do your development on a NTFS partition. Just the Python call is routed to Linux. 
If performance of the fitness function is an issue and you don't want to use the Linux subsystem for Windows, 
think about using the fcmaes java port: https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java[fcmaes-java]. 

==== MacOS

* `pip install fcmaes`

The {cpp} shared library is outdated, use the native Python optimizers. 

=== Usage

Usage is similar to https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html[scipy.optimize.minimize].

For parallel retry use:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes import retry
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds)
----

The retry logs mean and standard deviation of the results, so it can be used to test and compare optimization algorithms:
You may choose different algorithms for the retry:

[source,python]
----
from fcmaes.optimizer import Bite_cpp, De_cpp, Cma_cpp, Sequence
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, optimizer=Bite_cpp(100000))
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, optimizer=De_cpp(100000))
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, optimizer=Cma_cpp(100000))
ret = retry.minimize(fun, bounds, optimizer=Sequence([De_cpp(50000), Cma_cpp(50000)]))
----
