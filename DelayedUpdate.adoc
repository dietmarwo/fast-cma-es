== Delayed State Update

If your objective function is expensive to evaluate and poorly parallelized like in the 
domain of Hyperparameter Optimization 
(see the https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/HyperparameterOptimization.adoc[Hyper Parameter Tutorial])
it makes less sense to execute the optimization process using a parallel retry mechanism. 
Instead we should focus on parallel function evaluation, which usually scales much better than the
intrinsic parallelization of the objective function itself. For instance the evaluation of hyper parameters
for https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/python-package/xgboost/sklearn.py[xgboost.XGBRegressor] 
using cross validation can itself been parallelized using parameter `n_jobs`, 
see https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/house.py[house.py]. But it is much better 
to set `n_jobs=1` if the optimization algorithm supports parallel function evaluation. 
There are multiple options to implements this:

- Population based algorithms like 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/cmaescpp.py[CMA-ES] and
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/gcldecpp.py[GCL-DE]
provide a call to evaluate the whole population at once.
This can be implemented both as serial loop or using a parallel evaluator. Disadvantages are:

* If population size is smaller than or not a multiple of 
the number of available threads the CPU can not be fully utilized.

* If evaluations for specific parameters are more expensive than others, some threads will idle until  
the whole population is evaluated

- The optimization algorithm provides a `X = ask()` operation generating a sample based on its internal state,
and a `tell(X, y)` operation updating its state. If these operations work independently from the population
size, more individuals than a single population can be evaluated in parallel and new evaluations can be
triggered before the population is fully evaluated. 

Obviously the second option is preferable, although it imposes some challenges for the implementation of the
optimization algorithm, and only population based algorithms can support it. We implemented this idea
in Python both for https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/cmaes.py[CMA-ES] and
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/de.py[Differential Evolution]. There is no
reason to use {cpp} here because we only want to support very expensive objective functions, so the 
cost for the status update in `tell(X, y)` is negligible.

To reduce the delay of the update if the population size is smaller than the number of
parallel function evaluation processes/threads we could run multiple optimizers simultaneously.

image::delayedUpdate2.png[] 

If the state update is cheap in comparison to the function evaluation the optimizers
can run single threaded in a loop calling ask/tell for each optimizer in a sequence. 
Then each "ask" listens to a specific queue for its optimizer filled by a 
single result pipe listener running in a separate thread. This concept is not yet 
implemented in fcmaes because our experiments indicated even with an update
delay we still get acceptable results. 

==== Comparison with Hyperband Optimization

Note that the idea above is closely related to the
https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jamieson/hyperband.html[Hyperband Algorithm] with

- `X = ask()` equivalent to `get_random_hyperparameter_configuration`
- `tell(X, y)` equivalent to `tellrun_then_return_val_loss`

with a minor modification:

- The number of optimization algorithms running in the loop is reduced over time,
filtering out the ones with the worst solution so far. 

It becomes equivalent if the optimization algorithms were state-less and `ask()` returns
arbitrary random samples, and if the number of evaluators is equal to 
the number of "parallel" algorithm runs. Experiments show that both lead to inferior results. 
We save memory by not storing any algorithm state and CPU time
by not having to update this state. But 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/cmaes.py[CMA-ES] relies on 
highly efficient MKL/BLAS implementations 
(via https://markus-beuckelmann.de/blog/boosting-numpy-blas.html[Numpy]) and the state update effort for Differential 
Evolution is negligible. 

Nevertheless the Hyperband inspired idea 
using multiple instances of an optimization algorithm sharing a pool of parallel
function / loss evaluators and filtering out bad instances over time thereby increasing the
evaluation budget of the surviving instances is interesting. Specially for hard hyperparameter
optimization scenarios involving many parameters to be optimized. If GPUs are involved 
parallelization of the function/loss evaluation may be limited, then we could 
try a clustered solution based on https://docs.ray.io/en/master/cluster/index.html[ray] 
similar to https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-ray[fcmaes-ray].

==== Application to Hyperparameter Optimization

What happens if we apply delayed state update to the scenario described in the
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/HyperparameterOptimization.adoc[Hyper Parameter Tutorial]?
Again we use the tutorial code https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/examples/house.py[house.py]
and the same 16 core AMD 3950X machine for our tests:

For CMA-ES the call is:
[source,python]
----
from fcmaes import cmaes

   ret = cmaes.minimize(obj_f, bounds, popsize = 16, max_evaluations = 40000, 
   					workers = 32, delayed_update=True)
----
Note that for delayed update we have to use the Python
 https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/cmaes.py[variant]
`cmaes` instead of the {cpp} variant `cmaescpp`. 
Default behavior is that a call to evaluate the whole population at once is used. 
By by specifying `delayed_update=True` we switch "delayed update" on which is
based on the `X = ask()` and `tell(X, y)` calls. 

Our Python Differential Evolution 
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/fcmaes/de.py[implementation]
only supports sequential function evaluation or "delayed update". So it is 
sufficient to define `workers = 32`, there is no `delayed_update` parameter
as for CMA-ES.
 
[source,python]
----
 from fcmaes import de
 
   ret = de.minimize(obj_f, bounds, popsize = 16, max_evaluations = 40000, 
   					workers = 32)
----  

==== Myths regarding Hyperparameter Optimization

There are two myths regarding hyperparameter optimization 
(hyperparameters are the values controlling a machine learning process):

- https://www.kaggle.com/clair14/tutorial-bayesian-optimization[Bayesian Optimization]
  and http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/[Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE)] are hard to beat. 
  
- Usually testing a few hundred parameter sets is sufficient to find good values. 

Data from our  
https://github.com/dietmarwo/fast-cma-es/blob/master/HyperparameterOptimization.adoc[Hyper Parameter Tutorial]
combined with new results for "delayed" CMA-ES and DE (population size = 16, number of parallel threads = 32)
seems to confirm the myth: If we check the mean squared error after the same number of 
evaluations (cross validations) we see:

image::Hyper_Parameter_Optimization_300_evals.png[] 

- Specially with less than 100 evaluations TPE and Bayesian are superior.
- Even after 300 evaluations TPE and Bayesian still perform well. 

The truth behind these myths could be formulated as:

- If you want to evaluate not more than 300 cross validations, and you cannot execute multiple
cross validations in parallel (limited GPU resources, ...) then you can choose TPE or Bayesian optimization. 

Lets check what happens if we remove these limits as it can be done for CPU based regressors like the popular 
https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/python-package/xgboost/sklearn.py[xgboost.XGBRegressor].
Don't be fooled by the CPU utilization shown by the OS, when using XGBRegressor parameter
"n_jobs=32", which is the default on our 16 core / 32 thread machine:

image::cpuUsage.png[] 

It is the same as we see when using "n_jobs=1" and executing 32 XGBRegressor cross validations in parallel. 
But the number of validations per minute increases from about 3 to about 13 and above as can been seen in the 
top right corner of the diagrams. The CPU utilization shown indicates how much "room" the processor has to execute other tasks - in this case
it is fully utilized. But is is no indication how much work really is done - it can be the processor is busy 
transferring data between cores. Check the CPU temperature, it is usually higher when the processor is
doing "real" work. 

Therefore we no longer show performance in relation to evaluations but in relation to the time used. 


==== Performance of longer runs

image::Hyper_Parameter_Optimization_3000_sec.png[] 

When investing 3000 sec we already see a clear superiority for CMA-ES 16/32 and DE 16/32. 

image::Hyper_Parameter_Optimization_12000_sec.png[] 

After 12000 sec the gap to the conventional methods still increases.

image::Hyper_Parameter_Optimization_70000_sec.png[]

Finally we see that with CMA-ES 16/32 it may be worth to invest even more time.

==== Conclusion

- On a modern multi core processor hyperparameter optimization for CPU based regressors like `XGBRegressor`
can be improved by executing multiple cross validations in parallel 
instead of utilizing the internal parallelization of the regressor. 

- In this case CPU utilization can further be improved by using optimizers supporting delayed state update.  

- For longer execution times (> 1000 sec on a 16 core CPU) both differential evolution and CMA-ES clearly 
outperform TPE and Bayesian optimization when utilizing delayed state update. 

- For very long runs (> 50000 sec) CMA-ES + delayed update finds the best results. 

You should try both fcmaes CMA-ES and DE variants supporting delayed update beyond hyperparameter optimization.
Criteria for its applicability are:

- Very high cost for objective function evaluation.
- The objective function is CPU, not GPU based. 
- No intrinsic parallelization of the objective function or bad scaling.

Many simulation based objective functions fall into this category. But if possible, it is even better to 
execute parallel optimization retries instead of parallelizing objective function evaluation. For 
the https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/CTOC11.adoc[CTOC11 competition] we chose this option,
although the simulation performed by the objective function was quite costly. 

==== Remarks

- The the CMA-ES algorithm implemented in fcmaes is the well known "active CMA" algorithm, see
  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227050324_The_CMA_Evolution_Strategy_A_Comparing_Review[CMA_Evolution_Strategy]
- The DE variant used is special to fcmaes, it was successfully applied at the 
  https://github.com/dietmarwo/fcmaes-java/blob/master/CTOC11.adoc[CTOC11 competition].
  Other DE variants may perform significantly worse.
- GCL-DE, which is also implemented in fcmaes, doesn't support (yet) delayed update, but can evaluate a whole
  population in parallel. It requires a higher number of function evaluations, but performs also better than
  TPE and Bayesian optimization for very long runs. See "A case learning-based differential evolution algorithm for global optimization of interplanetary trajectory design,
